Backbone of Britain 

If you didn’t get a chance to visit the Commercial Vehicle show last month, there is no need to miss out. Read on for a round-up of news…

As soon as you see the New Ford Ranger Raptor you’ll know it’s not just another pick-up truck. It’s tough, smart and delivers a driving experience like no other. Raptor made its UK debut at the show and we expect to see our first deliveries in June. We can’t wait to get behind the wheel!
 	
Our New Transit with increased payload, built-in connectivity and more fuel efficient engines took pride of place at the show demonstrating the huge range available to suit every business need. With the introduction of a new high series range the New Transit promises to be our smartest and most productive yet. Due to arrive late July.
 
Fully charged, the New Transit Custom Plug-In Hybrid can take you an estimated 30 miles (48km)* using the electric motor alone which is ideal on those short trips in the city. On longer journeys, the 1.0 litre EcoBoost engine helps to extend the van’s range to an estimated 310 miles (500km)*. At the show we demonstrated this technology on both the Transit Custom and Tourneo Custom.
