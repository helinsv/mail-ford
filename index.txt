Targeting Prospect Customers
Our New Dealer Insights Tool will help you identify where your New Puma local target customers are. The national campaign will talk to 3 key audiences we are targeting with our national campaign: Futurists, Me Timers & Family Thinkers. We’ll be sharing more information on these targets to support your launch planning.
