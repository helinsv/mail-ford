It’s time to take a closer look at the tech-filled Fiesta 

Dear Dealer

Technology – when it works seamlessly, you don’t even notice it. That’s why, for the last 43 years, the Ford Fiesta has been reliably under the radar. But it’s time we told the world just what’s under the bonnet.

With over 15 technologies that help with driving, parking, safety and security – from pre-collision assist to traffic sign recognition – the Ford Fiesta is the most technologically advanced small car in the whole of Europe.

We’re launching a nationwide campaign and TV advert this August, to shine a light on the unseen Ford Fiesta technology – and we need your help to make it a success.

To support your communications, dealership assets will be available via the Ford Marketing Portal.

If you aren’t already signed up to the Ford Dealer Marketing Portal, please get in touch with your Dealer Systems Administrator. Email fmphelp@ford.com with any questions.	 
 
We look forward to working with you to bring the Ford Fiesta into the spotlight once again.
